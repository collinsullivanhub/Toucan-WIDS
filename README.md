**"The world is a jungle in general, and the networking game contributes many animals" - RFC 826**
 
Toucan is an open-source IDS written in Python that alerts and *defends* against several common types of network attacks. For example, "Man in the middle" attacks will be used by hackers to intercept traffic on a network. This is accomplished by sending gratuitous ARPs across a network to "poison" the default gateway and hosts. While ARPs are sent on IPv4 networks to poison targets, IPv6 networks also fall victim to impersonation through gratuitous neighbor advertisements being sent.

If Toucan detects malicious activity, it can respond. For example, if a gratuitous ARP were discovered being sent across a network, Toucan can unpoison the default gateway and the victim, and blacklist the attacker's L2.

Toucan uses *accept groups* and *deny groups* to determine which hosts sending traffic are legitimate, or allowed on the network. For example, in a IPv6 RA Flood, one attack association pattern Toucan will use is the fact that many different layer two addresses attached to RAs are being sent accross the network rapidly. Toucan will detect this by checking its accept group to see if that host is allowed on the network, allowed to send router advertisements, will determine that it is not, and will proceed to send a warning.

*I have included an example log file also in which I ran the program on a /24 network and did an arp-scan just to generate some activity*


# Usage:
- sudo python toucan.py 
- enter Default Gateway (192.168.0.1)
- enter network to monitor with netmask in format /X (192.168.0.1/24)
- enter network interface (wlp2s0/enp5s0/etc) (if you do not know this do an 'ifconfig' on linux)
- Populate the accept, deny, and traffic group lists (.txt files) with the layer 2 addresses of your choice
- Run the capture


# Rules to follow (generally)
- Accepted hosts should be put in the accepted ARP, NS, and NA files
- Accepted gateways should be put in accepted ARP, NA, and RA files
- Denied hosts placed in deny file
